# Privacy Policy for WebTeX (Safari Extension)

**Last Updated:** August 13, 2025

WebTeX respects your privacy. This policy explains how the extension handles your data.

## 1) What WebTeX Does
WebTeX detects math expressions on webpages and renders them using **KaTeX**.  
All parsing and rendering happen **on your device** within Safari.

## 2) Data Collection
WebTeX **does not collect, store, or share** any personal information.

- No account, login, or identifiers
- No analytics or telemetry
- No ads, SDKs, or tracking
- No clipboard access or keystroke logging

## 3) Data Transmission
WebTeX **does not send any data** to external servers.  
The extension operates entirely on-device; it only reads the current page’s content to locate math elements so it can render them.

## 4) Permissions & Page Access
To function, WebTeX needs permission to read webpage content where you enable it.  
This is used **solely** to find math expressions and render them with KaTeX.  
No content is persisted or transmitted by the extension.

## 5) Data Retention
WebTeX **retains no data**. When you close a page, there’s nothing stored by the extension.

## 6) Third-Party Libraries
WebTeX includes **KaTeX** (MIT-licensed) for local rendering.  
KaTeX runs entirely on-device and does not send data anywhere.

## 7) Children’s Privacy
WebTeX does not collect information from anyone, including children.

## 8) Changes to This Policy
If this policy changes, we’ll update the text at this URL and adjust the “Last Updated” date.
