# Privacy Policy for WebTeX

WebTeX does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

The extension runs entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers. It injects KaTeX locally to render LaTeX math on webpages. No usage tracking, analytics, or logging is performed.
